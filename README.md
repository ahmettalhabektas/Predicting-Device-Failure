## Introduction
Describe the goal of the project and the problem you are trying to solve. Include information about the dataset and its features.

## Data Preprocessing
Discuss the steps taken for data preprocessing, such as handling missing values, removing outliers, and converting data types.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Provide visualizations and insights obtained from exploring the dataset. This section helps in understanding the distribution of features and their relationships.

## Feature Engineering
Explain how new features are created or existing features are transformed to improve model performance.

## Undersampling
Describe the undersampling technique used to address class imbalance in the dataset.

## Model Evaluation
Evaluate multiple classifiers using various machine learning algorithms. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimize hyperparameters for selected models to improve their performance.

## Model Comparison
Compare the performance of different models and their confusion matrices.

## Best Model
Identify the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve
Visualize the ROC curve and calculate the area under the curve (AUC) for one of the models.
